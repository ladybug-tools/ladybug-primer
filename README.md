This primer provides an overview of the Ladybug components for Grasshopper.

Ladybug imports standard EnergyPlus Weather files (.EPW) into Grasshopper and provides
a variety of 2D and 3D interactive graphics to support the decision-making process during
the early stages of design. The tool also provides several simple geometry analyses,
including incident radiation and direct sun hours.

### Installation

See the [Wiki of the lbt-grasshopper repository](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/lbt-grasshopper/wiki)
