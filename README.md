This primer provides an overview of the Ladybug components for Grasshopper.

Ladybug imports standard EnergyPlus Weather files \(.EPW\) into Grasshopper and provides a variety of 2D and 3D interactive graphics to support the decision-making process during the early stages of design. The tool also provides several simple geometry analyses, including incident radiation and direct sun hours.

## Installation

See the [Wiki of the lbt-grasshopper repository](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/lbt-grasshopper/wiki) for the installation instructions for the entire Ladybug Tools Grasshopper plugin \(including ladybug-grasshopper\).
